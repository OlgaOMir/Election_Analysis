# Election_Analysis
## Module 3
### Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of this analysis was to review the elections data and provide a summary of election outcomes. 

### Election Audit Results

There were a total of 369,711 votes casted. Unfortunately, I was unable to debug the code that I have created and results that I have received are incomplete. 

### Election Audit Summary

I am receiving an error on line 36 of the code when I try to load the file as election_data.
